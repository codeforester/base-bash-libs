# `lib_std.sh`

`lib_std.sh` is the foundation library for Bash scripts in the Base family.

Bash is excellent glue, but raw Bash makes it too easy for every script to
invent its own logging, path handling, argument conventions, dry-run behavior,
error reporting, and import rules. `lib_std.sh` gives Bash code one shared
toolbox so scripts can stay small, readable, and consistent.

## Why This Makes Bash Scripting Better

The library improves Bash-based scripting in a few practical ways:

- **Consistent logs**: every script can emit timestamped logs with level and
  source location.
- **Logs stay on stderr**: stdout remains available for real program output that
  another command may pipe or capture.
- **Readable failures**: fatal errors include a message and Bash stack trace
  instead of a mysterious non-zero exit.
- **Safe command execution**: `std_run` preserves argument boundaries, supports
  dry-run mode, and can either exit or return a status.
- **Bounded command execution**: `std_run_with_timeout` applies the same command
  runner conventions with a timeout.
- **Shared dry-run behavior**: scripts do not need to reimplement "print what
  would happen" logic.
- **Composable cleanup**: scripts can register exit cleanup without replacing
  an already-installed `EXIT` trap.
- **Portable temp state**: scripts can create temp files or directories under
  `TMPDIR` and register them for cleanup in one call.
- **Non-fatal introspection**: scripts can resolve command paths and check
  function availability without turning every probe into a hard exit.
- **Simple library imports**: scripts can import helpers relative to their own
  source directory.
- **Predictable PATH edits**: PATH additions avoid duplicates and can prepend or
  append intentionally.
- **Batch validation**: required variables, files, directories, commands, and
  integer ranges can be checked with one helper call.
- **Safer filesystem helpers**: common operations report all failures in one
  clear error.
- **Base wrapper integration**: wrapper flags are recognized once and removed
  before command-specific argument parsing begins.

The goal is not to hide Bash. The goal is to make scripts fail in ways a user
or developer can understand.

## Loading The Library

Standalone scripts can source the library directly:

```bash
source "/absolute/path/to/lib/bash/std/lib_std.sh"
```

Base entrypoints preload this library through Base's own runtime bootstrap.
Standalone scripts should source it explicitly. Callers should run on Bash 4.2
or newer; the library has passive Bash version helpers, but sourcing it does not
prompt, install packages, or re-exec the caller.

## Initialization Contract

Sourcing `lib_std.sh` runs a small one-time initializer:

- initializes the logging level map
- records the original script arguments in `__SCRIPT_ARGS__`
- derives the caller's source directory in `__SCRIPT_DIR__`
- exposes the package version in `BASE_BASH_LIBS_VERSION`
- exposes the successful stdlib load marker in `BASE_BASH_LIBS_STDLIB_LOADED`
- consumes Base wrapper flags such as `--debug-wrapper`, `--verbose-wrapper`,
  `--utc-wrapper`, and `--color`
- resets the caller's positional parameters to the filtered argument list

Caller-visible globals:

- `BASE_BASH_LIBS_VERSION`: readonly package version read from the root
  `VERSION` file
- `BASE_BASH_LIBS_STDLIB_LOADED`: readonly marker set to `1` after
  `lib_std.sh` has initialized successfully
- `__SCRIPT_ARGS__`: original arguments before wrapper flags were stripped
- `__SCRIPT_DIR__`: absolute source directory for the script being bootstrapped

When a Base wrapper preloads the stdlib for another command, it can set
`BASE_BASH_BOOTSTRAP_SOURCE` so `__SCRIPT_DIR__` still points at the command
script rather than the wrapper.

## Version Requirements

Use `base_bash_libs_require_version` when a downstream script depends on APIs
added after the first public release:

```bash
base_bash_libs_require_version 1.1.0
```

The helper compares dotted numeric versions, returns silently when the loaded
library is new enough, and exits with a clear fatal error when the loaded
`BASE_BASH_LIBS_VERSION` is too old.

## Logging

Use structured logging for operational messages:

```bash
log_info "Installing package '$name'."
log_warn "Cache directory does not exist: $cache_dir"
log_error "Unable to read manifest '$manifest_path'."
log_debug "resolved_home=$resolved_home"
log_verbose "raw_response=$response"
```

Available levels:

- `FATAL`
- `ERROR`
- `WARN`
- `INFO`
- `DEBUG`
- `VERBOSE`

Change the default logger's level with:

```bash
set_log_level DEBUG
```

Named loggers are also supported:

```bash
set_log_level -l artifact DEBUG
log_debug -l artifact "registry key: $key"
```

For user-facing messages that should not include timestamps or source
locations, use:

```bash
print_error "Invalid project name."
print_warn "Using default workspace."
print_info "Setup complete."
print_success "Done."
print_message "plain stdout message"
```

`log_*`, `print_error`, `print_warn`, `print_info`, and `print_success` write to
stderr. `print_bold` and `print_message` write to stdout.

Colors are only enabled for terminal stderr when `--color` is passed. Set
`NO_COLOR` to disable colored output even when `--color` is present.

## Error Handling

Use `fatal_error` when the script cannot continue:

```bash
[[ -f "$manifest_path" ]] || fatal_error "Manifest '$manifest_path' was not found."
```

Use `exit_if_error` when checking a command's explicit status:

```bash
some_command
exit_if_error $? "some_command failed."
```

Fatal failures log the message, dump a Bash stack trace, and exit with the
original failing status when possible.

Not every user mistake should be fatal. Command-line usage errors should usually
print usage and return `2` rather than calling `fatal_error`, because the command
itself is fine and the user simply gave invalid arguments.

## Running Commands Safely

`std_run` is the preferred helper for simple external command execution:

```bash
std_run git status --short
std_run touch "file with spaces.txt"
```

It improves on ad hoc command strings because it:

- executes commands as argument arrays, not through `eval`
- preserves spaces and special characters
- logs a copy-pastable command in dry-run mode
- exits through `exit_if_error` by default when a command fails

Dry-run mode:

```bash
DRY_RUN=true
std_run brew install jq
```

`DRY_RUN` and `dry_run` both accept `true`, `1`, `yes`, and `on`. Use
`is_dry_run` when a script needs to branch on the same normalized dry-run state
without executing a command through `std_run`.

Handle a failing command yourself with `--no-exit`:

```bash
if ! std_run --no-exit grep "needle" "$file"; then
    log_info "needle was not present; continuing"
fi
```

For expected probe failures where the caller handles the status, add `--quiet`
to suppress the warning:

```bash
if ! std_run --no-exit --quiet test -f "$optional_file"; then
    log_debug "Optional file is absent."
fi
```

Use `std_run` for commands plus arguments. Keep shell features such as
pipelines, redirection, process substitution, and complex conditionals explicit
in the calling script so the code remains clear.

`run` remains available as a compatibility wrapper for existing callers, but new
code should use `std_run` to avoid collisions with test frameworks and other
Bash libraries that define their own `run` helper.

Use `std_run_with_timeout` when a command must finish within a bounded number of
seconds:

```bash
std_run_with_timeout 30 curl -fsSL "$health_url"
```

It accepts the same initial `--no-exit` and `--quiet` options as `std_run`:

```bash
if ! std_run_with_timeout --no-exit --quiet 5 nc -z localhost 5432; then
    log_warn "database port did not open within 5 seconds"
fi
```

Timeouts return status `124`. The helper prefers `timeout` or `gtimeout` when
available and otherwise uses a Bash fallback so scripts work on macOS and Linux.
As with `std_run`, command arguments are executed as an argument array and
dry-run mode logs without running the command.

## Importing Other Bash Libraries

Use `import` to source helper libraries:

```bash
import file/lib_file.sh
import /absolute/path/to/another_lib.sh
```

Relative imports resolve from `__SCRIPT_DIR__`, which is the directory of the
script being bootstrapped.

Important Bash detail: imported files are sourced inside the `import` function.
If an imported library needs global variables, declare them with `-g`:

```bash
declare -gA MY_LOOKUP=()
```

Without `-g`, Bash may create locals scoped to the import function.

## PATH Helpers

Use `add_to_path` instead of hand-editing PATH:

```bash
add_to_path "/opt/tool/bin"
add_to_path -p "$HOME/.local/bin"
add_to_path -n "$maybe_created_later/bin"
```

Options:

- `-p`: prepend instead of append
- `-n`: do not require the directory to already exist

`add_to_path` de-duplicates PATH after adding entries. You can also call:

```bash
dedupe_path
print_path
```

## Filesystem Helpers

The safe filesystem helpers collect failures and report them clearly:

```bash
safe_mkdir -p "$state_dir" "$cache_dir"
safe_touch "$log_file"
safe_truncate "$log_file"
safe_cd "$project_root"
```

These helpers are useful in setup scripts where a partially completed operation
should fail loudly and explain which path could not be created, touched, or
entered.

`safe_mkdir` accepts only `-p` as an option. Calling it without directory
arguments logs a warning and returns success without creating anything.

## Cleanup Helpers

Use cleanup registration when a script creates transient state that should be
removed on exit:

```bash
workspace="$(mktemp -d)"
std_register_cleanup_path "$workspace"
```

Cleanup paths are removed with `rm -rf --` from a shared `EXIT` trap. Empty
paths, root paths, and current/parent directory traversal components are
rejected before registration. When one call mixes safe and unsafe paths, safe
paths are registered, unsafe paths are rejected, and the helper returns nonzero.

For custom cleanup, register a function name:

```bash
cleanup_workspace() {
    rm -rf -- "$workspace"
}

std_register_cleanup_hook cleanup_workspace
std_unregister_cleanup_hook cleanup_workspace
```

Hooks run in registration order and duplicate registrations are ignored. If an
`EXIT` trap already exists when the first cleanup hook or path is registered,
that existing trap is preserved and runs before the stdlib cleanup hooks.

## Temporary Path Helpers

Use temp helpers when a script needs a scratch file or directory and wants the
path stored in a variable:

```bash
std_make_temp_file temp_file base
std_make_temp_dir temp_dir workspace
```

Both helpers create paths under `${TMPDIR:-/tmp}` using `mktemp` templates that
work on macOS/BSD and GNU systems. The created path is registered for exit
cleanup by default:

```bash
std_make_temp_dir workspace_dir
printf 'payload\n' > "$workspace_dir/input.txt"
```

Pass `--keep` when the caller intentionally owns cleanup:

```bash
std_make_temp_file --keep report_path report
```

The optional prefix is a filename prefix, not a directory path. It must be
non-empty and must not contain `/`. Set `TMPDIR` before calling the helper when
the temp root should be somewhere other than `/tmp`.

## Introspection Helpers

Use `std_command_path` when a script needs the path to an external command but
wants to decide what to do if it is absent:

```bash
if std_command_path git_path git; then
    std_run "$git_path" status --short
else
    log_warn "git is not available; skipping repository status."
fi
```

The helper stores an executable path in the named result variable and returns
nonzero with an empty result when the command is not found.

Use `std_function_exists` for predicate-style checks:

```bash
if std_function_exists cleanup_workspace; then
    std_register_cleanup_hook cleanup_workspace
fi
```

Use `assert_function_exists` when missing functions should be fatal:

```bash
assert_function_exists main cleanup_workspace
```

## Validation Helpers

Use assertions near the top of functions to make assumptions explicit:

```bash
assert_arg_count "$#" 2
assert_variable_name result_var array_var
assert_not_null BASE_HOME project_name
assert_integer retry_count
assert_integer_range retry_count 0 5
assert_command_exists git brew
assert_function_exists main cleanup_workspace
assert_file_exists "$manifest_path"
assert_executable "$project_root/bin/build"
assert_dir_exists "$project_root"
```

`assert_not_null` takes variable names, not expanded values. Use
`assert_not_null TOKEN`, not `assert_not_null "$TOKEN"`. When an argument is not
a valid Bash variable name, `assert_not_null` reports likely misuse without
echoing the invalid value.

Use `assert_variable_name` when a helper accepts variable names but does not
require those variables to exist or contain values.

The assertions favor clear failure messages over scattered one-off tests. Some
helpers check all provided values and report all missing items together.
Use `assert_executable` for explicit paths to project-local tools or scripts;
use `assert_command_exists` for commands that should be discoverable through
`PATH`.

## Interactive Helpers

For interactive scripts:

```bash
if ask_yes_no "Continue?"; then
    log_info "Continuing."
fi

wait_for_enter "Press Enter after reviewing the output."
```

Use `is_interactive` before prompting from code paths that might run in CI,
cron, or another non-interactive environment:

```bash
if is_interactive; then
    ask_yes_no "Install optional tools?" || return 0
fi
```

## Suggested Script Pattern

A small Base-style Bash command should look like this:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

main() {
    local project="${1:-}"

    if [[ -z "$project" ]]; then
        print_error "Project name is required."
        return 2
    fi

    assert_command_exists git
    log_info "Checking project '$project'."
    std_run git status --short
}

main "$@"
```

When the script runs through `basectl`, the Base runtime provides the stdlib and
calls `main` with wrapper flags already filtered out.

For standalone scripts that source the library directly:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
source "/path/to/base/lib/bash/std/lib_std.sh"

main() {
    set_log_level DEBUG
    std_run echo "hello"
}

main "$@"
```

## What Belongs Here

`lib_std.sh` should contain small, broadly useful primitives for Bash code:

- logging
- error handling
- path manipulation
- command execution
- imports
- validation
- simple filesystem safety wrappers
- exit cleanup registration
- temporary file and directory creation
- command and function introspection

Domain-specific behavior should live in other libraries or command modules. For
example, Git helpers belong in a Git library, file editing helpers belong in a
file library, and artifact setup behavior belongs in setup code.

## Tests

BATS coverage lives in:

```text
lib/bash/std/tests/lib_std.bats
```

When changing this library, run:

```bash
bats lib/bash/std/tests/lib_std.bats
```

For command-level changes that depend on stdlib behavior, also run the relevant
command BATS tests.
